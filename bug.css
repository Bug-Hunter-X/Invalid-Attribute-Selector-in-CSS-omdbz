The CSS code has an error where the selector is using an invalid attribute selector. The selector `.item[data-index=2]` is trying to select elements with the attribute `data-index` equal to `2`, but the attribute value is enclosed in double quotes, it should not be enclosed in double quotes.  The correct selector should be `.item[data-index="2"]` or `.item[data-index=2]` depending on how the attribute is defined.
